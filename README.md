# UX Journey<br>
<b>The process to optimize your resource for the quality User Requirement</b><br>
Several researchers agree that Requirement Engineering (RE) is one of the important factors that is the critical phase of software engineering (SE). Requirements are what the system should do and explain how it should do (Hidellaarachchi et al., 2022). RE activities in traditional Software Development Methods (SDM) are detailed activities and a list of the user requirement before coding or implementation, for the modern SDM like Agile it’s something flexible and iterative (Leau et al., 2012). This modern method focuses on communication between customers and developers. Moreover, in Agile, customer involvement is important, which means the developer's interpersonal and social skills in each iteration. Hence, effective, and efficient products are delivered to the customers and enlighten the development phase. The incremental requirement in the iterative phase of Agile has given dependency issues in design, rigidity, and mobility. The first issue, rigidity means that every change in the requirement implies sequence in the other modules. And for the second issue means the inability of the system to encapsulate components that can be reused. Hence, effective collaboration is very important to conduct effective software products. Moreover, collaboration with the customers with appropriate technical skills, interpersonal skills, and understanding of customer issues that combination of this activity we call socio-technical activity. That’s activity is very important to capture the human aspect in the RE process (Baham & Hirschheim, 2022; Hidellaarachchi et al., 2022; Leau et al., 2012).![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/993712/228732147-20a0a970-d32a-470b-acbe-06816da1efb1.png)
